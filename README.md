# Python Refresher Assignment

## echo.py
A script that imitates an echo. This is done by looping through the range of values of the word that is said, in reverse order.
It will take the last few letters of the word and print them out until the repititions run out, leaving a period at the end.

## fib.py
A script that runs the fibonacci sequence and times it using a decorator. It will give an elasped time and the answer after running the sequence for fibonacci.

This graph shows the time it takes to calculate the Fibonacci numbers, on the vertical or y-axis, it measures the time *(in seconds)* calculated for the fibonacci sequence.
On the horizontal or x-axis, it shows the numbers that were used for calcuating the Fibonacci sequence.
